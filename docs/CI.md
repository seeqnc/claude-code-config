### Color Principles

- **Dark-first**: The brand uses a predominantly dark theme. Default to dark backgrounds with light text.
- **Yellow as accent, not background**: Use seeqnc Yellow sparingly for emphasis — logos, interactive elements, key data points. Never as a large background fill.
- **High contrast**: Maintain strong contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum) between text and background.

## Logo

### Assets

- **Primary logo**: SVG wordmark (`logo.svg`) — lowercase "seeqnc" wordmark
- **Footer / mono variant**: `logo-footer.svg` — lighter or reversed variant for footers and secondary placements
- **Signet**: The standalone icon mark derived from audio sequence visualization

### Logo Rules

- Always use the SVG source files; never rasterize at low resolution
- Maintain adequate clear space around the logo (minimum: height of the letter "s" on all sides)
- Do not rotate, distort, recolor arbitrarily, or add effects (drop shadows, outlines, gradients)
- On dark backgrounds: use Yellow or White logo variant
- On light backgrounds (rare): use Black logo variant

## Visual Language — Sound Sequences

The core visual motif is derived from **audio sequences** — the "name-giving" concept of seeqnc. This translates into:

- **Geometric patterns**: Rectangular/bar-like shapes representing audio waveforms or spectrograms
- **The signet**: A compact icon built from these sequence shapes
- **Graphic patterns**: Used as backgrounds, section dividers, and decorative elements
- **Animations**: Large-scale motion graphics echoing audio visualization (pulsing, sequencing, rhythmic)

### Pattern Usage

- Use sequence patterns to reinforce the brand's connection to music and audio technology
- Keep patterns subtle on content-heavy pages; more prominent on hero sections and marketing materials
- Patterns should use brand colors only (Yellow on Black, White on Black, or subtle Gray on Dark Gray)

## Iconography

- **Style**: Minimal, line-based icons consistent with the geometric/technical aesthetic
- **Stroke weight**: Match the visual weight of PP Neue Machina Regular
- **Format**: SVG, single-color (adapt to context — White on dark, Black on light)
- Social icons used: LinkedIn, Instagram (SVG line variants)

## Imagery & Photography

- **Style**: High-contrast, atmospheric photography from the music and events world (DJ sets, festivals, live performances)
- **Treatment**: Dark, moody tones with selective color — often with yellow/warm accent lighting
- **Overlay**: Brand patterns or logo marks can be overlaid on photography in Yellow at reduced opacity

## Tone of Voice (for reference in design copy)

- **Technical yet accessible**: Explain complex AI/music-tech concepts simply
- **Confident and precise**: "AI-native content intelligence" — not vague, not overpromising
- **Industry-insider**: Speak the language of music rights, copyright, and content platforms
- **Action-oriented**: CTAs use `>>` arrows (e.g., "More >>", "Take me there >>", "Let's talk >>")

## Application Checklist
